    <p>Children are already learning at birth, 
        and they develop and learn at a rapid pace in their early years.
         The environments, supports, and relationships young children 
         experience have profound effects, and they thrive when they have
          secure, positive relationships with adults who are 
          knowledgeable about how to support their development and 
          learning and are responsive to their individual progress.</p>

<pre> William Shakespeare's name is synonymous with many of the famous
     lines he wrote in his plays and prose.</pre>
    <p> His poems are not nearly as recognizable to many 
     as the characters and famous monologues from his many plays. <br>
     In Shakespeare's era (1564-1616), 
     it was not profitable but very fashionable to write poetry. <br>
     It also provided credibility to his talent as a writer and
      helped <hr>
      to enhance his social standing.</p>
